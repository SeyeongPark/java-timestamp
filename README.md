# Employee Time Tracker

## ðŸ”Ž Details
A web application that helps employees and managers track time stamps.
All employees can record their working hours from start to end which will be calculated their working hours on the main page.

On the 'My Employee' page, a user who is assigned a 'manager' role can check not only all employees' information including their working hours but also update their salary information and specific position.
(For conveniently demonstrating this app, the timer will be counted as minutely not hourly)
